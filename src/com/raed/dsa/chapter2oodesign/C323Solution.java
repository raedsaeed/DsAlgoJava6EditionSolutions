Suppose you are designing a multiplayer game that has n â‰¥ 1000 players, numbered
1 to n, interacting in an enchanted forest. The winner of this game is the
first player who can meet all the other players at least once (ties are allowed).
Assuming that there is a method meet(i, j), which is called each time a player i
meets a player j (with i != j), describe a way to keep track of the pairs of meeting
players and who is the winner.
